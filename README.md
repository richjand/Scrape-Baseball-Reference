# Scrape-Baseball-Reference
R code to download and parse box scores from Baseball Reference. Relies primarily on Rvest and Dplyr.

This repository provides a function to download and parse batting data from box scores on Baseball Reference. The function takes a year as an input and downloads all batting data for that year.

In addition, the box score is parsed to provide information on at bat outcomes needed to calculate OBP, SLG, wOBA, or any number of other batting metrics.
